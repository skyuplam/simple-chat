# Chat

- Task: implement a chat client and server
- Position: front-end developer at Pexip

## Constraints

- You have to work on the task yourself, independently
- We expect you to spend around 4 hours.
- If you get excited and want to spend more time that is perfectly fine, just make sure to tell us roughly how much time you've spent on this
- Use any programming language to implement the server
- Avoid using a library to handle socket events for the front end
- Use either TypeScript or JavaScript
- If you're going to use a front end framework we would prefer it to be React, but use whatever framework you are most comfortable with. Vanilla Javascript is also accepted.
- You must use a git repository and commit frequently
- No rush, please come back to us whenever you have had time to look into this
- KISS: Keep It Simple

## Evaluation

- The primary goal of this exercise is to see how you work and structure your code as well as determine your technical skills.
- We want to go through the code with you in a following interview to discuss your technique and choices.

## Main tasks

- Implement a chat service, that supports at least 2 different devices at the same time
